The software must support the work of the campâ€™s registration clerk which is to handle applications to camp, payments, mailing of notices of acceptance and arrival instruction packets, check-in of campers, and assignment of campers to bunkhouses and teams. Do not make the software for network use, just offline use on a one desktop.

to run it you need to run the file called "start.py" from a shell then you will be asked for username and password, they are admin admin for admin session or guest guest for guest session
